# Assignment 5: SPARQL queries

## 1. Tasks

Create SPARQL queries that answer the questions shown below.

In the [UniProt SPARQL endpoint](https://sparql.uniprot.org/):

1. How many protein records are in UniProt?
2. How many Arabidopsis thaliana protein records are in UniProt? 
3. Retrieve pictures of Arabidopsis thaliana from UniProt.
4. What is the description of the enzyme activity of UniProt Protein Q9SZZ8?
5. Retrieve the proteins IDs, and date of submission, for proteins that have been added to UniProt this year.
6. How many species are in the UniProt taxonomy?
7. How many species have at least one protein record?
    - This might take a long time to execute
8. Find the AGI codes and gene names for all Arabidopsis thaliana proteins that have a protein function annotation description that mentions "pattern formation".

In the [MetaNetX SPARQL endpoint](https://rdf.metanetx.org/sparql):

9. What is the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (starts with “mnxr”) for the UniProt Protein uniprotkb:Q18A79?

In both UniProt and MetaNetX SPARQL endpoints:

10. What is the official Gene ID (UniProt calls this a “mnemonic”) and the MetaNetX Reaction identifier (starts with "mnxr") for the protein that has "Starch synthase" catalytic activity in Clostridium difficile (taxon 272563)?
